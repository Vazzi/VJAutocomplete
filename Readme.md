It is a basic autocomplete that helps user with writing. Very simmilr to classic web autocompletes.

Writen in Objective-C and also beeing rewriting to Swift (Will be here soon).

This repository has _VJAutocomplete_ writen in Objective-C in the directory _VJAutocomplete_ObjC_, then _VJAutocomplete_Swift_ (Comming soon) and _VJAutocompleteDemo_ project for you to see how it works. 

How it works
--------
_VJAutocomplete_ table for text field is pinned to the text field that must be given. User starts writing to the text field and _VJAutocomplete_ show if has any suggestion. If there is no suggestion then hide. User can choose suggestion by clicking on it. If user choose any suggestion then it diseppeared and add text to text field. If user continues adding text then _VJAutocomplete_ start showing another suggestions or diseppead if has no.
